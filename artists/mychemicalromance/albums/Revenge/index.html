              >Long ago. Just like the hearse you die to get in again. We are. So far from you. Burning on. Just like the match
              you strike to incinerate. The lives of everyone you know. And what's the worst you take. From every heart you break.
              And like the blade you stain. Well I've been holding on tonight. What's the worst that I can say? Things are better
              if I stay. So long and goodnight. And if you carry on this way. Things are better if I stay. So long and goodnight.
              Came a time. When every star falls. Brought you to tears again. We are. The very hurt you sold. Can you hear me? Are
              you near me? Can we pretend to leave and then. We'll meet again. WHen both our cars collide.</span

              >Oh baby here comes the sound! I took a train out of new orleans. And they shot me full of ephedrine. This is how we
              like to do it in the murder scene. Can we settle up the score? If you were here. I'd never have a fear. So go on
              live your life. But I miss you more than I did yesterday. You're so far away. So c'mon show me how. 'Cause I mean
              this more than words could ever say. You're beautiful! Well I'm a total wreck and almost every day. Like the firing
              squad or the mess you made. Well don't I look pretty walking down the street. In the best damn dress I own? We are
              young and we don't care. Your dreams and your hopeless hair. We never wanted it to be this way. For all our lives.
              Do you care at all?</span

            <span class="lyrics"
              >He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb. He's always choking from the stench and the fume. The wedding party
              all collapsed in the room. So send my resignation to the bride and the groom. Let's go down! This elevator only goes
              up to ten. He's not around he's always looking at men. Down by the pool he doesn't have many friends. As they are.
              Face down and bloated snap a shot with the lens. If you marry me. Will you bury me? Will you carry me to the end? So
              say goodbye to the vows you take. And say goodbye to the life you make. And say goodbye to the heart you break. And
              all the cyanide you drank. She keeps a picture of the body she lends. Got nasty blisters from the money she spends.
              She got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz she drives at 90 by the Barbies and Kens. If you ever say never
              too late. I'll forget all the diamonds you ate. Lost in a coma and covered in cake. Increase the medication. Share
              the vows at the wake. Kiss the bride. So say goodbye to the vows you take. And say goodbye to the life you make. And
              say goodbye to the heart you break. And all the cyanide you drank. So say goodbye to the last parade. And walk away
              as the parties fade. And say goodnight to the heart you break and all the cyanide you drank. To the end.</span
