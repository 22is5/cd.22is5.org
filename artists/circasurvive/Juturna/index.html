              Don't say a word. Don't be grateful if I ever made you laugh. Let's make believe what's at stake here's more than
              just your reputation. She's got the photos but no recollection. He's got the motive but no transportation. Purely
              curteous across her chest. Are you cutting me out now, after crawling inside. Turn away your head. What do I deserve
              instead? It's a surprise you haven't caught on yet. It's nothing personal, you're an embarrassment. Don't cut me
              out. We're offering nothing but the best accommodations. Just tell us who you are.

            <p class="lyrics">
              Will you walk straight, not like them. To fool them in, make it seem like you're in trouble. Make a sound, fake it
              enough. "What made you so scared?" Maybe you're mistaken for someone who cares. If you remember, I've been trying to
              get back to the center. I'm sure it's not like it was before. To make them drink, tell them that it's only water. No
              one leaves till we figure this out. Patience, both we and our words are over produced by influence.

              Alter and teach the ages, nothing you love lasts too long. A marvelous calm abandoned in the stages of birth mother
              vs. the mid wife. Who'll tell the children about their life. That's why you never mentioned my name to them. Denying
              us all of the moment. What brought you back to this place? I knew you'd never learn (it was obvious). Anything
              expected of you now, I knew you'd never learn. I'd place my bet down now, you'll be the first one to sell me out.
              That's why you never mention my name.

              Forced, we forced feeding you lines. Look how high I'm jumping from; you'll never make it. I know what it feels
              like, giving in to something you don't understand. Walk into the light. This sort of thing gets you out of mind
              right before impact. Calcium waste, litter and falling like icicles. Guess who's next? You're just as guilty as
              them.

              ast through the winter I swear to you now I won't call. Congratulations; Go home now. Will we last through the
              winter? Will we make it to see? I never wanted a partner and I never loved you, now you are free to leave. This
              heart is already frozen. I can't remember the fall. And if I last through the winter I swear to you now I won't
              call. It's too late, they won't let go. Follow five footsteps through that open door. It must be buried under the
              heart that makes this pace consistent. You'll find it torn, that gates been opened. And I've been wondering if
              you've been real with us. It's too late. It's that start stop and go you've been dying for.

              Make your move, obvious humor, desparate and respiratory plight. Always on, dressed to impress. I'll be the last one
              to find out why. Time takes its toll on us. This changes everything. I'd be a liar if I denied you at all. Now that
              I know this changes everything. I've been trading ideas with intriguing men and I percieve an honest solution to all
              of your pride. The amplifier screams out loud for the last time. Wave your hands at the audioence as you sink on in.
              Last chance to hide you need desoarately so. Find me. Motion fives up on you in the end. I'll try my best to be home
              by then. You see the grace we had, she'll never had. I'm going home but my own way. Going home on my own. I would
              really love if you'd sit him down. I would really love if you'd pull this thread.

              Don't be alarmed, I feel we're falling back to ground. Don't be afraid, I hear in every word they say. Even if you
              don't look back be sure and find out who was there and what they wore and ten more reasons. Your face is white and
              cocaine white. Misleading at most. I'm supoposted to imposter a new you. And even if you're woken up. Keep contact
              both at once. We've made mistakes like this. And I'm just learning. Spinning lights. Don't be scared. You have given
              so much more. Spinning lights take me there. He has risen, pull me under. Don't stop talking to me. I haven't been
              listening. This operation's been abandoned once again. Cut me gently, cut me out of mind.

              your words. You always said you'd tell me first. Verse after endless verse. I can't escape the echoed words. I love
              to find a cure for the feeling I find in these chords. I smile as it burns. I've been erased from the picture.

              Borders that we say are policing you back to their arms. Tension to take pills that'll make you feel higher inside.
              Do you often look back on us, feeling confidently? Would it make any difference if I wasn't late? Or I'd been to
              angry to show. The sovereign statement's wrong. It's a bi-law and a valiant one. To honor hopeful thoughts. It's the
              talent, not the promo-shots. Story has shown you all felt alone. Even if... if the sound it makes when it's
              tightening, sweet winding up of a mandolin hurts your fingers. And you try to hold on but it's not quite working.
              This reminds me of the sound you make when we disagree. Story has shown we all felt alone. Even if you've been so
              close you're not alone anymore. Still we grow.

              Leave as fast as you came. Without a sound. Nothing to ruffle your ends. I've been wandering around making up movies
              in my head. Se we say, don't let it go. Let we try and pull out pride. I already forget how I used to feel about
              you. Leave as fast as you came, no invitation, nowhere to go from here. I've been wandering around &nbsp; Wondering
              how I got so... So fuckin' boring all of a sudden, so fuckin' scared (I'm not scared). You'd mean so much more to
